# python-challenge-1

## Background:
Design an interactive ordering system from a food truck menu.
A main menu will be created along with a submenu with pricing.
The code will require user input and provide a detailed description of items ordered
such as the quantity, prices, and a total cost for a given order.
The code will use lists, a dictionary, conditional statements, for loops, and match case
statements.
This code is available at Github under (https://github.com/algjor/python-challenge-1/blob/main/menu.py)
